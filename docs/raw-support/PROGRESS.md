## Decisions Log

### Pending Decisions
1. Integration location (separate module vs. extend existing)
2. Fallback strategy (skip vs. EXIF-only vs. thumbnail-only)
3. Image processing mode (full quality vs. half-size)

### Made Decisions
1. **2025-10-05:** Selected `github.com/inokone/golibraw` as primary library
   - Rationale: Simple API, active development, production-ready
2. **2025-10-05:** Selected LibRaw over pure Go solutions
   - Rationale: Only solution that works with Leica M11 DNG files

---

## Notes & Observations

### 2025-10-05 - Initial Planning
- Created comprehensive plan for LibRaw integration
- Identified that all 30 Leica M11 DNG files currently fail with "unsupported color model"
- Researched and evaluated multiple options (LibRaw, pure Go, Adobe DNG SDK)
- Decided on LibRaw via golibraw as best solution despite CGO complexity
- Created planning documents in `docs/raw-support/`

### 2025-10-05 - Confirmed Current Failure Mode
- Verified error: `failed to decode image: tiff: unsupported feature: color model`
- Error occurs in `golang.org/x/image/tiff` decoder
- Root cause: Leica M11 Monochrom DNG files use "PhotometricInterpretation: Linear Raw"
- Standard Go TIFF decoder only supports basic TIFF color models (RGB, RGBA, Grayscale, Paletted)
- Does NOT support RAW sensor data (Linear Raw, CFA Pattern, etc.)
- This confirms LibRaw integration is necessary to process these files

### 2025-10-05 - LibRaw Integration Attempt (Phase 1 Completed)
-  ✅ **Installed LibRaw 0.21.4** via Homebrew
- ✅ **Verified installation** with pkg-config
- ✅ **Installed golibraw** Go bindings (v1.0.2)
- ✅ **Created proof-of-concept** programs (poc.go, poc2.go)
- ✅ **Successfully extracted metadata** from Leica M11 DNG:
  - Camera: Leica M11 Monochrom
  - Lens: Apo-Summicron-M 1:2/50 ASPH.
  - ISO, Aperture, Shutter, Image Size all extracted correctly
- ⚠️ **Image decoding encountered issue**: `ppm: not enough image data`
  - This is a known limitation of golibraw's PPM-based image export
  - Metadata extraction works perfectly
  - Full image decoding requires more investigation or alternative library
- ✅ **Created RAW decoder modules**:
  - `internal/indexer/raw.go` (CGO build)
  - `internal/indexer/raw_nocgo.go` (fallback)
- ✅ **Successfully compiled** indexer with LibRaw support

**Status:** Phase 1 mostly complete. Metadata extraction proven working. Full RAW image decoding needs additional work to resolve PPM decoder issue in golibraw or switch to alternative approach.
