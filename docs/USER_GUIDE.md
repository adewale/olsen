## Understanding Filters

Filters help you narrow down photos by asking:

### üìÖ When? (Time Filters)

**Year:** Which year?
- Click any year to see photos from that year
- Example: "2024" shows all 2024 photos

**Month:** Which month? (appears after you pick a year)
- Narrows to a specific month
- Example: "November" shows November photos

**Time of Day:** What time was it?
- Dawn, Golden Hour, Midday, Blue Hour, Night
- Example: "Golden Hour" shows sunset/sunrise photos

### üì∑ What? (Equipment Filters)

**Camera:** Which camera?
- See photos from specific cameras
- Example: "Canon EOS R5" shows only R5 photos

**Lens:** Which lens?
- Filter by lens used
- Example: "24-70mm" shows photos with that lens

### üé® How? (Style Filters)

**Colour:** What's the dominant color?
- Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Purple, Pink, B&W
- Example: "Blue" shows photos with lots of blue

**Orientation:** Portrait or landscape?
- Landscape (horizontal)
- Portrait (vertical)  
- Square

### ‚ö° Technical Filters

## How Filtering Works

### The Rule: Everything Stays

**When you click a filter, ALL your other filters stay active.**

Example:
```
You have: 2024 + Blue
‚Üí Click: Canon
‚Üí You get: 2024 + Blue + Canon
(Photos from 2024 that are blue, shot with Canon)
```

This is different from folder navigation where picking a new folder loses your place.

### Smart Counts

Numbers next to each filter show "how many photos if I click this?"

Example:
```
Current: 2024 + Blue (350 photos)

Year filter shows:
  2025 (280)  ‚Üê 280 blue photos from 2025
  2024 (350)  ‚Üê Currently selected
  2023 (120)  ‚Üê 120 blue photos from 2023
  2022 (0)    ‚Üê No blue photos from 2022 [disabled]
```

**Gray/disabled means:** "No photos match if you add this filter"

### Removing Filters

**Three ways to remove filters:**

1. **Click the √ó on a chip:**
   ```
   [Blue √ó] [2024 √ó] 
   ‚Üí Click √ó on "Blue" ‚Üí Now just [2024 √ó]
   ```

2. **Click "Clear all":**
   ‚Üí Removes everything, shows all photos

3. **Use browser back button:**
   ‚Üí Goes back to previous filter state

## Tips & Tricks

### Start Broad, Get Specific

‚úÖ Good: Year ‚Üí Camera ‚Üí Color ‚Üí Orientation
‚ùå Less helpful: Trying to set everything at once

**Why:** Each filter guides you to the next logical choice

### Watch the Numbers

Numbers = Your guide to what's possible

- **Big numbers:** Lots of photos to explore
- **Small numbers:** Very specific results
- **Zero (grayed out):** No photos match

### Use "Clear All" Liberally

Don't be afraid to start over!

- Filtering is exploration, not commitment
- Clear all and try a different path
- You can't break anything

### Browser Back Button Works

Made a mistake? Hit back!

- Each filter click is saved in browser history
- Back button = undo last filter
- Forward button = redo

### Combine Unexpected Filters

Try combinations like:

- Flash + Night (flash photography at night)
- Portrait + Wide Angle (environmental portraits)
- Golden Hour + 85mm (portrait sunset shots)
- Blue + Winter (winter landscape with blue tones)

## Troubleshooting

### "I have zero results!"

**Problem:** Too many filters applied

**Solution:**
1. Look at recently applied filters (blue chips)
2. Remove the last one or two (click √ó)
3. Or click "Clear all" to start over

### "Why can't I click this filter?"

**Problem:** Filter is grayed out (count = 0)

**Reason:** No photos match that combination

**Example:**
```
Current: 2024 + Canon
2023 is grayed out ‚Üí No Canon photos from 2023
```

**Solution:** Remove a filter to make it clickable again

### "Where did my Month filter go?"

**Not a problem:** Month only appears after you select a Year

**Why:** Showing month without year would be confusing

**To see it:** Click any year first, then Month appears

### "Photos aren't loading"

**Possible causes:**
1. Slow internet connection (thumbnails loading)
2. Very large result set (thousands of photos)
3. Browser issue (try refreshing)

**Solution:** Wait a few seconds, or try simpler filters
